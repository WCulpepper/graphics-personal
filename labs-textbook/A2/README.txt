This project showcases a geometry shader (wireframe), as well as tessellation shaders for the teapot. 
In addition, there is a Perlin noise texture generated that's applied to the scene.

Usage and compilation:
To compile this code, use the same process we use in class (cmake, make, run). 

Bugs, implementation details:
The teapot isn't working with the shaders fully, it's rendering black.

This assignment took me about 6 hours, give or take.
It was fun! 10.
